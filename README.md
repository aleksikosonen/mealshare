Mealshare is a webpage for viewing and uploading food related media and recipes. 

A registered user can login in from the landpage and a new user can follow the link to signup-page.

Once user is logged in, the feed is shown to user. Here user can browse posts, the post's recipes and comment them. User can also make own posts wich contain a picture and an caption. User can also upload a recipe related to that post. Posts can be deleted on user's own profile. Site also has admin-accounts which can delete posts from feed directly. Other user-account related settings and credentials can be edited via My Profile page.

Site has a search feature where user can search content by usernames or hashtags from the post's captions, for example #neapolitan or #pizza.
